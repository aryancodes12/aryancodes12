# 👋 Hey there! I'm Aryan Gupta

I'm a first-year **B.Sc. (Vocational) Data Science & AI** student at *Bhavan's College, Andheri*. Having recently stepped out of 12th grade, I'm venturing into the fascinating world of technology with curiosity and drive.

With a passion for data science, I'm currently learning Python as my first programming language—and it's been quite the ride so far!

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Exploring
- Python fundamentals — variables, data types, loops, and functions  
- Version control with Git and GitHub  
- Basics of data science and its real-world applications  
- Beginner-friendly projects to sharpen my growing skillset  

## 🎯 My Goal
To become a data scientist and use the power of data to tackle real-world challenges in innovative ways.

## 🛠️ Projects in Progress
I'm working on small Python projects to apply what I'm learning. Stay tuned—bigger things are coming!
