# Hi there, I'm Aryan Gupta 👋

I'm a first-year **B.Sc. (Vocational) Data Science & AI** student at **Bhavan’s College, Mumbai**, currently building my foundations in **Python**, **data analysis**, and **Linux (EndeavourOS/Arch)**.

I enjoy learning by building practical projects — from **modular CLI applications** in Python to **data analysis and visualization** tasks. I actively participate in hackathons and focus on developing real-world problem-solving skills through hands-on experimentation.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Python fundamentals and automation  
- Building modular CLI tools with JSON-based persistence  
- Git & GitHub workflows  
- Data analysis concepts and visualization techniques  
- Linux fundamentals using Arch-based systems (EndeavourOS)

---

## 🛠 Projects
- **Modular CLI Task Manager (Python & JSON)** — persistent storage, modular design, ongoing improvements  
- **Data Analysis Projects (R & Python)** — EDA, regression models, and visualization  
- **CLI Practice Projects** — strengthening control flow, input handling, and logic building  

More projects are actively in progress 🚧

---

## 🎯 Goal
To grow into a **Data Scientist** by building strong technical foundations and working on data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
